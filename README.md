## 👋 Hi there, I’m [Your Name Here]

I'm a developer and researcher with a background in **Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science**, passionate about building real-world systems that combine **AI, robotics, and embedded computing** to improve human life.

### 💡 What I Do

- 🧠 **AI & Signal Processing for Healthcare**  
  I led the development of *iCrutch*, a real-time eye-tracking diagnostic pipeline for detecting nystagmus using Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn. The system achieved **91% accuracy** on real patient data and won **2 awards** at JHU’s Design Day.

- 🤖 **Robotics Software & Surgical Systems**  
  As a Robotics Software Intern at JHU’s Computer Integrated Interventional Systems Lab, I engineered models to improve targeting precision on the **Galen surgical robot** by 25%, reducing tool error through real-time calibration and control optimization.

- 💊 **Embedded Systems for Assistive Tech**  
  I developed the software and firmware for a smart pill dispenser that helps Alzheimer’s patients adhere to medications — including custom **Arduino control logic** and a Python-based desktop interface. Our team won **1st place** at WashU’s BME Synapse competition.

- 🧬 **Computational Research in CRISPR & Mental Health**  
  I built a relational database of gene therapy targets for MDD and modeled CRISPR delivery systems using spatial pharmacokinetic simulations. My work evaluated feasibility and off-target effects in proposed therapeutic strategies.
